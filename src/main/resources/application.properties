# Security configurations to mitigate CVE-2025-24813
# The default servlet is disabled by default in Spring Boot
# Partial PUT support is enabled by default in Tomcat
# While Spring Boot doesn't expose a direct property to disable partial PUT,
# the vulnerability requires specific conditions that are not met in default configurations:
# 1. Writes must be enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
# 2. Uploading to security-sensitive directories (application-specific)
# 
# Upgrading to Tomcat 9.0.99 addresses the underlying vulnerability
