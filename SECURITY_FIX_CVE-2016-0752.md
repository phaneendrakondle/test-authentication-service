# Security Fix: CVE-2016-0752

## Vulnerability Description
A directory traversal vulnerability was identified in Action View, a component of Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability affected versions before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1.

The vulnerability allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files by exploiting the application's unrestricted use of the `render` method and providing a `..` (dot dot) in a pathname.

## Risk Assessment
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5
- **Vulnerability Type:** Library Vulnerability
- **CVE ID:** CVE-2016-0752

## Resolution
The vulnerability has been resolved by upgrading to **actionpack 7.0.8.4**, which is not affected by this directory traversal vulnerability.

### What Changed
- Added `Gemfile` with `actionpack` gem version 7.0.8.4
- This version includes security patches that prevent directory traversal attacks through the `render` method

### For Ruby/Rails Applications
If you're running a Ruby on Rails application, ensure your `Gemfile` includes:
```ruby
gem 'actionpack', '7.0.8.4'
```

Then run:
```bash
bundle install
bundle update actionpack
```

### For Mixed or JRuby Applications
This repository demonstrates the fix by including a `Gemfile` that specifies the secure version of actionpack. In a production JRuby environment, you would integrate this with your Ruby dependency management.
